Since that time I've read through as much material as one can only possibly go through, along with making pet projects and taking classes at freeCodeCamp, Udemy and RS school. Currently working as an office manager my furthure goal is to land a job as a junior front-end developer. Furthermore, taking in account all my prior experience,  I would describe myself as a fast learner and great team member with analytical and creative thinking.
